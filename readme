Bio-nic Reading 

Bionic Reading is a new method facilitating the reading process by guiding the eyes,
through text with artificial fixation points.
As a result, the reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial letters 
and lets the brain center complete the word. 
In a digital world dominated by shallow forms of reading,
Bionic Reading aims to encourage a more in-depth reading.

How to use:

This is a colab notebook.
Download the .pynb file and run it using colab or any jupyter environment.
Upload any .txt file and run all.
It will return a bionic script which you can use.

Next update:

Working on converting this into an API and open-sourcing the code.
